                To the most wonderful mom in the world,<br><br>
                Today and every day, I want you to know how much you mean to me. 
                Your love is my strength, your guidance my compass, and your smile my happiness. 
                No words can truly express how grateful I am to have you in my life.<br><br>
                Thank you for all the sacrifices you've made, for your endless patience, 
                and for loving me unconditionally. You're my hero, my confidant, and my best friend.<br><br>
                I love you more than words can say! ❤️
